Collaborative Adventure 001
============================================================

Paul and Jay write adventures for classic fantasy roleplaying games.

Methodology:

1. Make a simple, boring, bad adventure.
2. Trade it back and forth, making one change at a time, until it's not bad and boring.

The maps use Alex Schroeder's [Gridmapper](https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/Gridmapper).
