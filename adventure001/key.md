Adventure 001: Goblin Mine
============================================================

Kobold mine on a mountain.
Kill them and take their stuff!

There are yaks outside the mine, near the entrance.  The yaks in this area are unusual in that they are black and blond striped, highly intelligent, and part of a hivemind.  They can communicate telepathically, but not in a way that players can immediately understand, though players can detect that something is happening because they emit dim flashes when communicating.  When players are being communicated with, they also flash, but in an out-of-sync manner until they learn to communicate intelligbly with the yaks.  Eating yak cheese made with one of the ores in the mine enables telepathic communication with the yaks.



Level 1

1. **Mine entrance.** A crude door stands in the rock face beside a mountain trail.
2. 20×20′ **Room.** A **goblin** stands here.
3. 20×20′ **Room.** A **goblin** stands here.
4. **Stair Landing** A 20′ wide hallway leads east and west, spiral staircases visible at the ends.

6. 20×20′ **room.** A **goblin** stands here. A bag holding **50 cp** sits in the north-west corner of the room.

8. **Stairs to Mine.** A wide spiral stair descends. A hand-pained wood sign reads "DA HOLE" in Goblin.


Level Above 1 (The Nest)
------------------------------------------------------------

1. 40×40′ **Nest Landing.** Statue of a giant flying eagle with a yak grasped in it's talons. Wear marks on the floor hint that rotating the statue releases portcullis to the aerie. Wide spiral stairs wind down to level 1 (7).
2. 20×30′ **Harness Room.** Hooks on the wall hold a large leather harness, bridal, looped animal control pole, and various leather accouterments. A severely dented and bloodstained helmet lies in a corner, conspicuous for its white pain and exaggeratedly domed shape. A large wood bin holds straw and sticks.
3. **Aerie.** A landing exposed to the open air overlooks a long drop. A 10′ diameter nest sprawls in the center. Examination of the nest reveals recent but inexpert repairs. A **goblin** sits in the nest, wearing an egg costume (steel painted white — AC 4). Every thirty minutes, the goblin bows a brass horn that sounds like very loud, very sick goose.
4. 30′ octagon **Strongroom** The locked chest holds **5 gp**, 100 sp, 300 cp, and a bawdy goblin graphic novel worth 10 gp to the right buyer. In front of the chest, a **trap** drops the unwary down a steep corkscrew shoot to level 3, room 1. A bronze eagle sconce adorns both pillars. Pulling down the sconce on the south pillar safely locks the trap door closed.


Level 2 (Mine Vestibule Level)
-------------------------------------------------------------

1. 40×80′ **Equipment Storage Room** Contains mining equipment, (pickaxes, carts, shovels, helmets, torches, some assorted pieces of kobold clothing in bad condition.)  It also contains a 
2. 30×50′ **Ore/rock/material Storage Room** Contains piles of various raw, indiscernible substances.  Locked door on the south end.  The lock is sturdy.
3. 30×30′ **Counting/valuables room** Contains 3 treasure chests on near the south wall.  There are two desks, one with small piles of indiscernible ores, like the ones in the ore storage room on it.  The other desk has nothing on top.  Both desks have drawers.
4. 40×20′ **Guard room** There is a locked door on the northern wall next to a barred window leading into the landing area.  There is a small shelf/table under the window.  There are two chairs near the south wall.  There are some more pieces of kobold clothing here.
5. 40×40′ **Stairs Landing Area** There is a 20′ wide ramp leading down into the relative darkness to the north.


Level 3 / Xvart Lair
-------------------------------------------------------------

1. 30′ octagon **Jail Cell** Anyone who falls down the shoot from The Nest room 4 lands here. The spring-loaded door and steep ramp make climbing _up_ the shoot difficult. Numerous hash marks from former prisoners scar the walls.
2. **Cavernous main room**: has a large fire in the middle.  There is a hole in the ceiling above the fire about 0.5m in diameter that leads up into the darkness.  There are yogurt pools along the south and west walls.
3. **Xvart Laboratory**:  There is a **Xvart Shaman** in here, doing research on potions, cheeses, and powders made from sentient yak milk, fungus/ores, and other, more pedestrian potion ingredients.  The shaman has a staff topped with the horn of a yak and a helmet made out of a yak skull.
4. **Yak pens**:  There is a large oval-shaped room leading from the main room with multiple yak pens in it.  There are yaks in some of the pens.  At the far south end of the room, there is a pen with a Yak calf in it.  There are two guards guarding this pen.
