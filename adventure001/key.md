Adventure 001: Goblin Mine
============================================================

Goblins started digging a mine on the mountain.
Kill them and take their stuff!


Level 1
------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Mine entrance.** A crude door stands in the rock face beside a mountain trail.
2. 20×20′ **Room.** A **goblin** stands here.
3. 20×20′ **Room.** A **goblin** stands here.
4. **Stair Landing** A 20′ wide hallway leads east and west, spiral staircases visible at the ends.
5. 20×20′ **Room.** A **goblin** stands here.
6. 20×20′ **room.** A **goblin** stands here. A bag holding **50 cp** sits in the north-west corner of the room.
7. **Stairs to Nest.** A wide spiral stair ascends. A hand-painted wood sign reads "DA NEST" in Goblin. Sticks and bits of straw litter the steps.
8. **Stairs to Mine.** A wide spiral stair descends. A hand-pained wood sign reads "DA HOLE" in Goblin.


Level Above 1 (The Nest)
------------------------------------------------------------

1. 40×40′ **Nest Landing.** Statue of small figure (goblin or dwarf??) riding a giant flying eagle. Wear marks on the floor hint that rotating the statue releases portcullis to the aerie. Wide spiral stairs wind down to level 1 (7).
2. 20×30′ **Harness Room.** Hooks on the wall hold a large leather harness, bridal, looped animal control pole, and various leather accouterments. A severely dented and bloodstained helmet lies in a corner, conspicuous for its white pain and exaggeratedly domed shape. A large wood bin holds straw and sticks.
3. **Aerie.** A landing exposed to the open air overlooks a long drop. A 10′ diameter nest sprawls in the center. Examination of the nest reveals recent but inexpert repairs. A **goblin** sits in the nest, wearing an egg costume (steel painted white — AC 4). Every thirty minutes, the goblin bows a brass horn that sounds like very loud, very sick goose.
4. 30′ octagon **Strongroom** The locked chest holds **5 gp**, 100 sp, 300 cp, and a bawdy goblin graphic novel worth 10 gp to the right buyer. In front of the chest, a **trap** drops the unwary down a steep corkscrew shoot to level 3, room 1. A bronze eagle sconce adorns both pillars. Pulling down the sconce on the south pillar safely locks the trap door closed.


Level 2 (Mine Vestibule Level)
-------------------------------------------------------------

1. 40×80′ **Equipment Storage Room** Contains mining equipment, (pickaxes, carts, shovels, helmets, torches, some assorted pieces of kobold clothing in bad condition.)
2. 30×50′ **Ore/rock/material Storage Room** Contains piles of various raw, indiscernible substances.  Locked door on the south end.  The lock is sturdy.
3. 30×30′ **Counting/valuables room** Contains 3 treasure chests on near the south wall.  There are two desks, one with small piles of indiscernible ores, like the ones in the ore storage room on it.  The other desk has nothing on top.  Both desks have drawers.
4. 40×20′ **Guard room** There is a locked door on the northern wall next to a barred window leading into the landing area.  There is a small shelf/table under the window.  There are two chairs near the south wall.  There are some more pieces of kobold clothing here.
5. 40×40′ **Stairs Landing Area** There is a 20′ wide ramp leading down into the relative darkness to the north.


Level 3
-------------------------------------------------------------

1. 30′ octagon **Jail Cell** Anyone who falls down the shoot from The Nest room 4 lands here. The spring-loaded door and steep ramp make climbing _up_ the shoot difficult. Numerous hash marks from former prisoners scar the walls.
