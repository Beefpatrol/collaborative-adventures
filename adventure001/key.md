Adventure 001: The Milky Mines of Møllehøj
============================================================

Place this adventure for characters levels 1–3 in any mountainous region.


Rumors
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Children have disappeared from a nearby village.
2. Years ago, goblins mined ore in these mountains.
3. Jeb's cousin saw a roc flying through the mountains last month.
4. Strange lights have started flashing on the mountain at night.
5. A dozen wild yaks wandered through the village last week, and knocked over the fruitseller's stand.
6. There've been a lot more rats lately. They brazenly roam the streets by daylight!


Level 1: Mine Entrance
------------------------------------------------------------

There are **yaks** outside the mine, near the entrance.  The yaks in this area are unusual in that they are black and blond striped, highly intelligent, and part of a hivemind.  They can communicate telepathically, but not in a way that players can immediately understand, though players can detect that something is happening because they emit dim flashes when communicating.  When players are being communicated with, they also flash, but in an out-of-sync manner until they learn to communicate intelligbly with the yaks.  Eating yak cheese made with one of the ores in the mine enables telepathic communication with the yaks.

1. **Mine entrance.** A crude door stands in the rock face beside a mountain trail.
2. 20×20′ **Room.**
3. 20×20′ **Room.**
4. **Stair Landing** A 20′ wide hallway leads east and west, spiral staircases visible at the ends.
5. 20×20′ **Room.** Two **xvarts** stand here.
6. 20×20′ **room.** A bag holding **50 cp** sits in the north-west corner of the room.
7. **Stairs to Nest.** A wide spiral stair ascends. A hand-painted wood sign reads "DA NEST" in Goblin. Sticks and bits of straw litter the steps.
8. **Stairs to Mine.** A wide spiral stair descends. A hand-pained wood sign reads "DA HOLE" in Goblin.


Level Above 1: The Nest
------------------------------------------------------------

1. 40×40′ **Nest Landing.** Statue of a giant flying eagle with a yak grasped in it's talons. Wear marks on the floor hint that rotating the statue releases portcullis to the aerie. Wide spiral stairs wind down to level 1 (7).
2. 20×30′ **Harness Room.** Hooks on the wall hold a large leather harness, bridal, looped animal control pole, and various leather accouterments. A severely dented and bloodstained helmet lies in a corner, conspicuous for its white pain and exaggeratedly domed shape. A large wood bin holds straw and sticks.
3. **Aerie.** A landing exposed to the open air overlooks a long drop. A 10′ diameter nest sprawls in the center. Examination of the nest reveals recent but inexpert repairs. An **xvart** sits in the nest, wearing an egg costume (steel painted white — AC 4). Every thirty minutes, the xvart bows a brass horn that sounds like very loud, very sick goose.
4. 30′ octagon **Strongroom** The locked chest holds **5 gp**, 100 sp, 300 cp, and a bawdy kobold graphic novel worth 10 gp to the right collector. In front of the chest, a **trap** drops the unwary down a steep corkscrew shoot to level 3, room 1. A bronze eagle sconce adorns both pillars. Pulling down the sconce on the south pillar safely locks the trap door closed.


Level 2: Mine Vestibule Level
-------------------------------------------------------------

1. 40×80′ **Equipment Storage Room** Contains mining equipment, (pickaxes, carts, shovels, helmets, torches, some assorted pieces of kobold clothing in bad condition.)  It also contains a ................

3. 30×30′ **Counting/valuables room** Contains 3 treasure chests on near the south wall.  There are two desks, one with small piles of indiscernible ores, like the ones in the ore storage room on it.  The other desk has nothing on top.  Both desks have drawers.
The middle treasure chest contains a potion of climbing, a healing potion, a bag of irritating dust that resembles one of the ores in the other room, a small onyx yak figurine, and a brass horn that makes the very sick goose noise. 
4. 40×20′ **Guard room** There is a locked door on the northern wall next to a barred window leading into the landing area.  There is a small shelf/table under the window.  There are two chairs near the south wall.  There are some more pieces of kobold clothing here.
5. 40×40′ **Stairs Landing Area** There is a 20′ wide ramp leading down into the relative darkness to the north.


Level 3: Xvart Lair
-------------------------------------------------------------

Notes on Xvart: AC 7, 1-1 hit dice, 1 attack, average intelligence, chaotic evil alignment, standard magic resistance, normal/lieutenant Xvart are level 1, give 5XP + 1 per hit point. Leader Xvart are lvl 1, give 20 XP + 2 per hit point. This is according to the fiend folio. Not sure how to morph this into LOTFP.

1. 30′ octagon **Jail Cell** Anyone who falls down the shoot from The Nest room 4 lands here.
The spring-loaded door and steep ramp make climbing _up_ the shoot difficult.
Numerous hash marks from former prisoners scar the walls.
2. **Cavernous main room**: has a large fire in the middle.  There is a hole in the ceiling above the fire about 0.5m in diameter that leads up into the darkness.
There are yogurt pools along the south and west walls.
There is a **Xvart Lieutenant** here, (8HP).
3. **Xvart Laboratory**:  There is a **Xvart Shaman** (6HP) in here, doing research on potions, cheeses, and powders made from sentient yak milk, fungus/ores, and other, more pedestrian potion ingredients.
The shaman has a staff topped with the horn of a yak (worth 600sp, can cast "Speak with Animals", has a built in compass whose needle is a piece of shimmering blue ore) and a helmet made out of a yak skull (worth 60sp, has two spherical pieces of shimmering blue ore in the eye sockets).
4. **Yak pens**:  There is a large oval-shaped room leading from the main room with multiple yak pens in it.  There are yaks in some of the pens.  At the far south end of the room, there is a pen with a Yak calf in it. Two Xvarts guarding this pen. One guard is a **Xvart Lieutenant** (8HP), the other is the **Xvart Leader** (11HP).
5. **Cheese Wheel Trap.**
 An 8′ wheel of cheese stands on its end here, at the crest of the corridor that slopes south-west.
 The cheese careens perilously down the hallway, crushing (save) anyone who opens the **trapped door** in the intersection before disarming the trap using the **lever at A**.
6. **Yak Princess Jail.**
 The xvarts hold the **yak princess** hostage in this jail cell.
7. **Boudoir of the Rat Queen.**
 The **wererat** lounges on a gilt, velvet-cushioned recamier.
 Normal and giant rats frequent the room, reporting to their queen.
 A long, narrow tunnel heads up and north, eventually emerging on a hillside overlooking the nearby village.
8. **Game Room.**
 A 8×8 two-tone grid is chalked on the floor of this small room.
 Crudely-carved figurines, about 6″ tall, stand on some of the squares.
 Close examination reveals the figures are made of hard cheese.
9. **Rats' Nest.**
 Four **giant rats** skulk here.
 Their filthy nest hides gnawed bones and **40 cp**.
